                            <h2>A Day with Technology</h2>
                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">A post-apocalyptic short story.</p>
                            <p>My alarm goes off. I wave my hand to silence the ringing noise and I hesitantly get up from bed. As I sit up, holograms displaying the weather, news stories, my calendar, and my social media notifications appear in my bedroom. As I move through my morning tasks, these holograms follow me through my house. With a quick shutter sound, the operating system in the house takes a picture of me, captioning it “Monday morning selfie,” and shares it to my favorites list. Before leaving the house, I take my contacts out of their charging case and slip them on. After a few blinks, the same OS in my house transfers onto my contacts. As I scroll through my messages, a red alert pops up on the right corner of my eye—I’m late for work.</p>
                            <p>I hop into my self-driving car, and set the location to my office downtown. My car chooses to take the shortest route to work, through the slums. I’d rather go through the country side, where the sights are a little more pleasant—but the car knows best. As we pass through the slums, hordes of the homeless are scattered about. Unemployment has taken a drastic jump in the past five years, leaving many people homeless—even some friends that I used to have. But they made the mistake of trying to get a career in medicine or finance. There isn’t much need for those jobs anymore—the robots can do that by themselves. So basically the only successful jobs left are the engineers and the artists—things that not everyone can do. I’m fortunate however, my parents pushed me to study computer science, and guess what—I’m surviving. Although it may not be the most interesting job in the world, it allows me to live a decent lifestyle, unlike the poor guys outside my window. Well, they should have saw this coming.</p>
                            <p>My car transports me to the Class B parking lot. I grab my Virus-Containment Mask and step out of the car. Because Class B is technically in the outskirts of the slums, certain precautions were needed. The homeless have been eaten alive by thriving viruses. The government refuses to give them the pills that we take regularly. We joke that it’s for population control. But I guess I shouldn’t be talking—I’m only in Class B. Not even good enough to get a parking lot in a quarantine zone. There are homeless clinging on to the fence surrounding the parking lot. Seeing me, they start begging for food and medicine—the usual. I turn the other way, and start walking towards my office building. A homeless man follows me on the other side of the fence continuing his pleading. I ignore him and focus on getting to work on time. I glance over and he is still there. How long will he follow? As I approach the building, the doors scan the ID on contacts and the doors open. Taking my mask off, I look behind at the homeless man. As the man furiously shakes the fence, a security bot approaches him. Damn it, he should’ve left when he had the chance. The bot issued the normal command and proceeded to shoot the man. It’s become a regular event. You’d think with all the advances in artificial intelligence, they would’ve installed some compassion into the security bots. But hey, as long as they’re not targeting me, I’m fine with it.</p>
                            <p>Finally I get to my office and put my things on my desk. As I get some coffee from the kitchen I am alerted that I am getting fined due to my untimely attendance. The fines are piling up these days—I wonder if I’m actually making any money. Sighing, I sit down on my chair and get to work. My job consists of monitoring the processes of the social media website, TruLife. Well I guess I don’t monitor the processes, the computers do—I'm here "just in case." TruLife is a platform for users to share info and “connect.” Many of the users are just bots with artificial intelligence, and sometimes it’s really hard to tell. One of my friends had an intimate conversation with "Lucy Jane," only to find out that she was a bot. We gave him a tough time about that one. I open TruLife on my contacts and browse through my newsfeed. Luckily, since I’m a TruLife employee, the site is not blocked for me. They think I’m working. Too bad ESPN is blocked from the workplace, I need to see the highlights for the Bot Fight that I missed last night.</p>
                            <p>It’s 6 PM and I am alerted that my shift is over. Eleven hours of staring at a computer—not one problem. Some people call this a good day. I call it a boring one. The more interesting days are when I actually have something to do, a problem to debug. But, I guess I shouldn’t be complaining. As I leave the office, I see the limp body of the homeless man outside the fence. Surprising that the cleanup bots haven’t gotten rid of the body yet. Maybe a malfunction? I step into my car and head home. I pass the thousands of homeless stuck in the cold weather and eventually arrive at my house. I remove my contacts and slip into bed, and drift off to sleep.</p>
                            <p>My alarm goes off. I wave my hand to silence the ringing noise and I hesitantly get up from bed…</p>

                                <h4>Let's start.</h4>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/gallery/GithubTutorial/Github_sc.png" alt="">
                                <p>First step is to get a <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub account</a>. Then you'll want to create a new repository and title it as such:</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/gallery/GithubTutorial/reposname.png" alt="">
                                <p>Obviously you will fill in your own user name instead of 'nnandigam23'. You can initialize the repository with a README file, if you want. Click "Create repository".</p>
                                <p>Now you should consider where you want your HTML, CSS, JS, etc. to be located. You will push these files from their location to Github. You can either have the files located locally on your computer, or store them on a cloud platform. For example, I keep all my web files on <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/home">Dropbox</a>. That way my website is not tied to my computer, instead it exists on the cloud. This could be useful if I were to lose my computer, or something happened to my hard drive. However, you are betting that Dropbox doesn't lose your files too. I recommend using a cloud-based storage application and keeping a recent copy of your work on a local machine as backup.</p>
                                <h4>Using Git</h4>
                                <p>Now we're going to use Git from the terminal to push your files to GitHub. Before that you'll want to copy the url of your repository to your clipboard. Other than copying the address from the top bar, there is a button under "<strong>HTTPS</strong> clone URL" on the right of the page that copies the url to your clipboard. So go ahead and launch your terminal (or powershell, if you're on Windows). eavigate to the folder where your web files are located. If you are new to the terminal, typing <code>ls</code> will display all the files and folders contained within the folder you are currently in. Typing <code>cd Folder</code> will get you to the folder specified (the folder has to be contained by the folder where you were previously). The command <code>cd ..</code> will get you up one folder. So once you're at the correct folder, enter the command:</p>
                                <pre>git clone https://github.com/nnandigam23/nnandigam23.github.io</pre>
                                <p>You'll want to insert that link that you copied where I have my url in the command. Now you should have a folder name 'username.github.io' where all your files are. In your Finder (or Windows Explorer), go ahead and move all those files into this new folder. Now in the terminal go to this new folder:</p>
                                <pre>cd username.github.io</pre>
                                <p>If you type in <code>ls</code> you should be able to see all the files you moved to this folder. So GitHub uses 'index.html' as your homepage, so you'll need to rename your main HTML page to 'index.html'. Once all your files are ready, enter:</p>
                                <pre>git add *</pre>
                                <p>This command readies all your changed files (in this case, new files) for deployment to GitHub. If you only want to add a single file, simply change the <code>git add *</code> to <code>git add file.name</code>. Next, you have to commit these changes. This is where you can type a message explaining the changes you have made during this particular upload. This is helpful when you are looking back on all the past versions of your code, and you want to know what changes were made:</p>
                                <pre>git commit -m "blah blah blah"</pre>
                                <p>You can enter your message in the between the quotation marks. So now we can push our code to the repository. To do this, type:</p>
                                <pre>git push origin master</pre>
                                <p>Once you enter this, you should be prompted for your username and password. Enter these in, and you should be good to go! Wait for the success message to display, and go check your repository to see your newly-added files.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/gallery/GithubTutorial/repository.png" alt="">
                                <p>The moment you have been waiting for: viewing your website. To do this simply type in 'username.github.io' into your search box. Behold, your website. That's the address for your website, so go ahead and share it to everyone.</p>
                                <h4>Making Changes to your Website</h4>
                                <p>This is what makes GitHub ideal for implementing fixes. Simply edit or files to your username.github.io folder. Then in the terminal, once you've navigated to the folder, type:</p>
                                <pre>git add .</pre>
                                <pre>git commit -m "your message"</pre>
                                <pre>git push origin master</pre>
                                <p>And that's it. Hope you enjoyed. Happy coding &nbsp;<i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up"></i></p>
